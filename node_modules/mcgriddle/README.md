# McGriddle

McGriddle is a get-out-of-your-way Sass library designed to help you build based a grid system. Suports [flexbox](#grid-flexbox) (the grid is based on floats, by default). Set up your grid system…

```scss
$grid-width  : 64em;
$grid-gutter : 1.875em;
$grid-columns: 12;
```

…and you’re ready to build.

```html
<section class="container">
  <article class="article"></article>
  <div class="sidebar"></div>
</section>
```

```scss
.container { @include container; }
.article   { @include columns(8); }
.sidebar   { @include columns(4, last); }
```

## Installation

1. Install via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcgriddle), yarn or [Bower](http://bower.io).
  ```
  npm install mcgriddle

  yarn add mcgriddle

  bower install mcgriddle
  ```

  Also available as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/mcgriddle) to use within your Rails application—see [below](#install-for-ruby-on-rails) for more information.

  Or to manually install it, [download](https://github.com/jonsuh/mcgriddle/archive/master.zip) and unzip the source files. Then copy the files from the `_sass/mcgriddle` directory into your project.

2. Import the `_mcgriddle.scss` file in your Sass manifest file:

  ```scss
  @import "mcgriddle";
  ```

### Install for Ruby on Rails

1. Add McGriddle to your Gemfile.

  ```
  gem 'mcgriddle'
  ```

2. Run `bundle install`.
3. Include McGriddle by using Sass’s native `@import`*

  ```scss
  // application.scss
  @import "mcgriddle";
  ```

  \* [More information](https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-labs/labs/structure-your-sass-files-with-import) on why Sass’s native `@import` + why you should ditch Sprockets directives altogether.

## Usage

First, create a settings file (`_mcgriddle-settings.scss`) and import it _before_ importing McGriddle.

```scss
@import "mcgriddle-settings";
@import "mcgriddle";
```

Then edit the settings file to customize/override default grid settings. The following is a list of settings and its defaults:

```scss
$grid-width          : 64em;
$grid-gutter         : 1.875em;
$grid-columns        : 12;
$grid-minor          : 1/3;
$grid-collapse       : false;
$grid-rtl            : false;

$grid-flexbox        : false;
$grid-flexbox-wrap   : wrap;
$grid-flexbox-justify: flex-start;
```

Features:

1. [Containers](#container)
2. [Columns](#columns)
3. [Collapse gutters](#grid-collapse)
4. [Flexbox support](#grid-flexbox)
5. [Right-to-left support](#grid-rtl)

#### `container()`

You’ll need a container to wrap the columns in.

```scss
.container {
  @include container;
}

// Container with no max width ($grid-width)
.container--full {
  @include container(false);
}
```

#### `columns()`

Then use `columns()` on an element to specify how many columns wide it should be.

```scss
.column {
  @include columns(8);
}

.column-decimal {
  @include columns(5.6);
}

// Last column
.column-last {
  @include columns(4, last);
}

// Centered column
.column-center {
  @include columns(8, center);
}

// Relative columns
.column-4-9 {
  @include columns(4 of 9);
}
.column-5-9 {
  @include columns(5 of 9, last);
}
```

Nest columns by wrapping nested columns in a container.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="columns-9">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="columns-6"></div>
      <div class="columns-6"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="columns-3"></div>
</div>
```

Push an element however many columns with `shift()`.

```scss
// Shift a column over 2 columns
.column {
  @include columns(6);
  @include shift(2);
}
```

#### `$grid-collapse`

Collapse gutters: `$grid-collapse: true`. (Default is `false`)

```scss
$grid-collapse: true;
.container { @include container; }
```

#### `$grid-flexbox`

Flexbox support (as opposed to floats): `$grid-flexbox: true`. (Default is `false`)

```scss
$grid-flexbox: true;
.container { @include container; }
```

#### `$grid-rtl`

Right-to-left support for RTL languages: `$grid-rtl: true`. (Default is `false`)

```scss
$grid-rtl: true;
.container { @include container; }
```

## That’s it?

The documentation is still a work-in-progress, so there are features and functionality that have yet to be properly documented. I also have a couple more features I’d like to build (when and if I decide to), but aside from that… yep, that’s it.

I originally created McGriddle for me—I wanted something stupid simple and straight forward. Therefore if you’re looking for something more robust, I’d suggest [Bourbon Neat](https://github.com/thoughtbot/neat) or [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/).
